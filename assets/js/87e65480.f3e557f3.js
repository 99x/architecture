As we all know architecture is important for any software product. We typically call it the structure of structures."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"Suppose you going to build a house. The nature of the foundation differs based on your soil in the land, the number of floors in the house, etc. Also, things like the wiring and water lines are things, difficult to change after laying out. On one side, it's not much different from the architecture of a software product."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"That's why the architecture decisions need to be well thought of. Besides these decisions are costly to change."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"The Challenge for Architects\nAs you can see, Architects have to take these decisions one way or the other. And at this level, no right or wrong decision exists. So the architects need to be savvy with experience to find their way through to take these decisions for the best interest of the software product at hand."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"Typically these decisions are taken after analyzing the quality attributes of the software product or platform, and addressing the tradeoffs across them."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"Let me take an example to explain this. Think you are a startup with a short time window to enter the market. What's most important here is to keep the Architecture simple enough so that it maximizes faster software delivery. And if the software product is in the financial domain that handles payments and transactions, there is no shortcut for security. Though the speed is needed, the product and its development need to comply with the required level of Secops, such as secure coding, vulnerability assessment, and active monitoring."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"And one of the main challenges with software products is that things change over time.
