Another common reason to use a database abstraction layer is to decouple business/domain-specific code from the choice of database. The use of an abstraction layer is a classic technique for decoupling distinct parts of a software system; promoting looser coupling, higher cohesion and a better separation of concerns. If you\u2019re simply using the database for data storage, the use of the database abstraction layer allows you to, in theory, change your database via configuration, without changing any code.

Of course, you could add another layer over the top of your chosen database abstraction layer to further isolate your business logic and provide the ability to easily swap out your database abstraction layer but, again, you\u2019ve made another significant decision.
