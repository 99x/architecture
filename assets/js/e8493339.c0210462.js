Significant decisions are usually related to key technology choices (e.g., programming languages and frameworks), generally applicable tactics (e.g., inter-component communication), and the overall structure (monolithic deployment unit vs. microservices). Aspects such as 'tabs vs. whitespaces', or 'curly braces on the same line vs. the next line', are probably not architecturally significant!
