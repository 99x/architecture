The house's foundation should deliver expected qualities based on soil in the land, the size of the building, and not forget the requirements of the residents. The needs of the residents are prone to change over time; however, fundamentals such as the house's layout, the strength of the base, and electrical and plumbing lines are difficult to change after initial laying out. In this essence, the digital product architecture is not much different from the architecture of a building.
